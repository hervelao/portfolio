          <p style="font-size: 18px;">Months ago, with nearly 200,000 entrants around the world, I put myself through the agony of the CFA examinations, for the third and fortunately last time.<p>

          <p style="font-size: 18px;">The three rounds of exams are known to be tough (around 55% of candidates are likely to fail at each stage of their attempt). Just like many, the CFA exams monopolized my days and nights for almost two years. I spent over 1,000 hours of study, attempting to pass them on first attempt... It was one of the most challenging but rewarding steps I have ever taken, that required strong discipline.</p>

          <p style="font-size: 18px;">Nevertheless, the road to reach my goal to advance in my investment career is far to be over. It is important to keep in mind that the finance industry is an <u>extremely fast-moving one</u>. Indeed, employers are beginning to prefer practical tech skills as they recruit recent graduates and thus there is a growing demand for it among young professionals in order to stay relevant and competitive.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Growing demand for practical tech skills</h2>

          <p style="font-size: 18px;">It is something that I had clearly observed. Technical knowledge that was missing from me, from AI to big data and robo-advice... And much more are to come. Knowing this, I chose to learn to code.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">A Dream to Excel</h2>

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

          <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
