          <p style="font-size: 18px;">Months ago, with nearly 200,000 entrants around the world, I put myself through the agony of the CFA examinations, for the third and fortunately last time.<p>

          <p style="font-size: 18px;">The three rounds of exams are known to be tough (around 55% of candidates are likely to fail at each stage of their attempt). Just like many, the CFA exams monopolized my days and nights for almost two years. I spent over 1,000 hours of study in total, so that I didn't have to waste years on retakes... It was one of the most challenging but rewarding steps I have ever taken, that required really strong discipline from me. The CFA journey added to my credibility, and allowed me to understand the different sectors in finance much better; regardless of the path I will pick. I took joy in the journey itself.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Growing demand for practical tech skills</h2>

          <p style="font-size: 18px;">Nevertheless, I am not sure it has enable the career change I'd hoped for. Sure, it is a signal of competence and I learned a lot, but it doesn't replace heavy networking, intense job hunting and technical skills. Indeed, I always kept in mind that the finance industry is an <u>extremely fast-moving one</u>. Clearly, employers are starting to prefer practical tech skills as they recruit recent graduates, supported by the emergence of the new economy and FinTechs. There is a growing demand for practical tech skills among young professionals in order to stay relevant and competitive in this business.</p>


          <p style="font-size: 18px;">Artificial Intelligence, Big data, robo-advice, and more are to come. Even the CFA Institute has decided to revamp its exams to include questions on these new tools. Knowing this, and taking advantage of my motivation to learn new stuffs, I decided to gain strong experience in coding and revisit my foundation in statistics and mathematics. Of course, my interest in technology and some entrepreneurial ambitions helped me to take that choice.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">A Dream to Excel</h2>

          <p style="font-size: 18px;">Bootcamps offer has big advantages. They afford you the luxury of a comprehensive education whilst reducing the cost of your time. Typically lasting weeks rather than years, and making the transition as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p style="font-size: 18px;">Bootcamps codense practical skills, core knowledge, and the most widely used frameworks that consists roughly the same amount of contact hours that would be received during a Computer Science undergraduate degree. One big advantage is the practical application of the content that is taught. It is centred around problems and tasks you will meet in the workplace, rather than diving deep into theoretical topics. The end goal is to build a skill set that will secure you a new job in the industry.</p>

          <p style="font-size: 18px;">I would also argue that everything I learned during these past 18 months of taking data science classes I could have learned by reading books, watching online videos and perusing through the documentation for different software packages. However, there is no doubt in my mind that going to a bootcamp has accelerated my learning and has given me valuable experience working with real projects that can be discussed in interviews and used in a portfolio. I never could have imagined to work on how to optimize a neural network if I was just sat at home watching Youtube videos.</p>

          <br><br>

          <p style="font-size: 18px;">Being curious about softwares and data science led me to this path, and I wish more people would feel that way. I took time to invest in obtaining the skiils and good habits of a truly skilled data scientist will set me apart from the rest. As I stand out here in the wonders of what can be done, I do feel confident enough that I can go away and continue to develop my own data science and machine learning skills, as well as applying them in my future projects.</p>
